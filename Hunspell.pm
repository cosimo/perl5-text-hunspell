Text::Hunspell - Perl interface to the GNU Hunspell library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # For this example to work, you have to have
    # the US english dictionary installed!

    use warnings;

    use Data::Dumper ();
    use Text::Hunspell;

    # You can use relative or absolute paths.

    # ADVANCED STUFF FROM HERE
    # NOT SURE HOW IT SHOULD WORK

    #
    # Test here generator for morphological modification (NOM->ACC)
    #

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface to the OO B<Hunspell> library.
This module is to meet the need of looking up many words,
one at a time, in a single session, such as spell-checking
a document in memory.

The example code describes the interface on http://hunspell.sf.net

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

B<You MUST have installed GNU Hunspell library version 1.0 or higher>
on your system before installing this C<Text::Hunspell> Perl module.

Hunspell location is:

    http://hunspell.sf.net

There have been a number of bug reports because people failed to install
hunspell before installing this module.

This is an interface to the hunspell library installed on your system,
not a replacement for hunspell.

You must also have one hunspell dictionary installed when running the module's
test suite.

Also, please see the README and Changes files.  README may have specific
information about your platform.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=head2 C<Text::Hunspell->new($full_path_to_affix, $full_path_to_dic)>

Creates a new speller object. Parameters are:

=over 4

=item full path of affix file

=item full path of dictionary (dic) file

=back

Returns C<undef> if the object could not be created, which is unlikely.

=head2 C<check($word)>

Check the word. Returns 1 if the word is found, 0 otherwise.

=head2 C<suggest($misspelled_word)>

Returns the list of suggestions for the misspelled word.

=head2 C<analyze($word)>

Returns the analysis list for the word.
TODO HOW? What does it return??

See the examples in the examples/ folder for now.

=head2 C<stem($word)>

Returns the stem list for the word.

=head2 C<add_dic($path_to_dic)>

Adds a new dictionary to the current C<Text::Hunspell> object.

=head2 C<generate2($stem, \@suggestions)>

Returns a morphologically modified stem as defined in
C<@suggestions> (got by analysis).

TODO Explain ...

=head2 C<generate($stem, $word)>

Returns morphologically modified stem like $word.

TODO WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM generate2() ???
EXPLAIN.

=head1 BUGS

Probably. Yes, definitely.
