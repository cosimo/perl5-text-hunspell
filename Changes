2.14    2016/01/14 08:36:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        No functional changes. Now Text::Hunspell depends on Alien::Hunspell
        version 0.04. Should finally compile nicely on Win32 platform.

2.13    2016/01/11 10:59:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        Win32 build support added (Graham Ollis, @plicease).
        This should make Text::Hunspell build correctly on Windows. \o/

        *** If you're using Win32, make sure you use a recent version of
        Alien::Base (>= 0.024) and/or Alien::Hunspell (soon-to-be 0.04)

2.12    2015/12/18 10:35:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        Replaced ExtUtils::PkgConfig with Alien::Hunspell. This should allow
        Text::Hunspell to build on non-pkgconfig-enabled systems, even though
        I'm not sure how reliably it works. Will have to evaluate from CPAN
        testers results. Thanks to Alien* expert Graham Ollis for this
        contribution.

2.11    2015/05/12 14:19:07 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        No functional changes, only minor cleanups and a fix for RT#99810
        (compilation on non-gcc based systems). Thanks to bjakubski for sending
        in patches on Github.

2.10    2015/03/26 11:24:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        Fixed GH#5 (http://github.com/cosimo/perl5-text-hunspell/issues/5).
        Should make Text::Hunspell installable without pain from CPAN and
        cpanminus clients. The problem was in the undeclared use of
        ExtUtils::PkgConfig, which needs to be known even before running
        the configure (Makefile.PL) step. Thanks to Pavel Shaydo for reporting
        the problem.

2.09    2014/10/20 07:56:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        Fixed RT#99548, which should make it easier to install Text::Hunspell
        on most systems. Basically replace my broken way of checking for
        libhunspell by looking up pkgconfig using ExtUtils::PkgConfig.
        Thanks to David Gutteridge for teaching me how to do it!

2.08    2013/05/01 23:22:35 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        Improved main POD documentation for Hunspell.pm.
        Fixes RT#84964. Thanks to Paul Flo Williams for the patch.
        (https://github.com/cosimo/perl5-text-hunspell/pull/2)

2.07    2013/03/26 20:45:00 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        DEPRECATED the delete() method, and implemented proper
        object handles in the hunspell XS glue. Again, thanks to
        Paul Flo Williams for patch and test case. Closes RT#84054.

2.06    2013/03/09 11:39:28 Europe/Oslo (cosimo)

        Implemented new add_dic() function from hunspell API.
        Fixes RT#83765. Thanks to Paul Flo Williams for patch
        and test case.

2.05    2012/09/21 08:17:00    (cosimo)

        Fixed RT#79630 incorrect encoding of Hunspell.pm POD documentation.
        Thanks to Paul for the patch.

2.04    2012/09/20 23:05:00    (cosimo)

        Fixed t/02_pod.t test due to newest Test::Pod and
        missing =encoding directive. Thanks to SHLOMIF for
        the patch.

2.03    2011/06/24 11:12:00    (cosimo)

        Fixed use of "qw()" as parenthesis in inc/Devel/CheckLib.pm
        because deprecated in perl 5.14. Thanks to H. Merijn Brand
        for reporting.

2.02    2010/10/24 13:02:00    (cosimo)

        Added an explicit warning if the unversioned libhunspell.so
        symlink or library is not found. Linking will almost certainly
        fail.

2.01    2010/09                (cosimo)

        Fixed build/test problems

2.00    2010/09                (cosimo)

        Now cosimo at cpan dot org is a co-maintainer for Text::Hunspell.

        Added a dirty hack to work around some underlying changes in
        libhunspell that made the XS code unable to initialize any
        Hunspell object.

1.xx    Author and maintainer was ELEONORA
